This is a space to document my development journey and share what I learn along the way.

## Technical Stack

This blog is built with:

- **Astro**: Static site generator optimized for content-focused websites
- **Netlify**: Deployment and hosting
- **Tailwind CSS**: Styling
- **Markdown**: Content writing

I chose Astro for its performance and simplicity in handling content-heavy sites.

## Purpose

As I work on various projects, I often:

- Learn new technologies
- Try different approaches to problems
- Work through technical challenges
- Document solutions and learnings

Writing about these experiences helps me understand them better, and perhaps these notes will be useful to others as well.

## Future Content

Topics will include:

- Technical learnings
- Problem-solving processes
- New technology experiments
- Practical development insights

Each post will focus on specific technical challenges and their solutions.
