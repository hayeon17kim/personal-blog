Today I learned quite a bit while setting up my personal blog with Astro. Here are the key takeaways:

- **Markdown vs Astro**: While Astro components (.astro) are powerful, Markdown (.md) files are more suitable for content-focused pages. I switched my About page from .astro to .md for better maintainability.

- **Content Organization**: Astro has a nice way of organizing content - 'posts' for longer articles and 'notes' for shorter updates. This helps keep different types of content well-structured.

- **Styling Flexibility**: Learned how to customize hover effects and social icons using Tailwind CSS. Small CSS tweaks can significantly improve the user experience.

- **Frontmatter Power**: The frontmatter section in Markdown files (the part between --- marks) is crucial for metadata. It controls things like titles, descriptions, and publication dates.

Looking forward to documenting more learnings here!
